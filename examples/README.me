<h1> Examples </h1>

There are five examples to build and sign a raw transaction. These demonstrate how to use the class and one wallet example.

The wallet example has a send transaction, stake deposit transaction, withdraw deposit transaction, and a smart contract transaction.

The wrapping and unwrapping of tfuel in the wallet example will keep the wtfuel in the wtfuel contract and when unwrapped return it back to tfuel.  If you want to move it to your wallet you would need to run the transfer function from the wtfuel contract or create a smart contract to convert it then transfer it out all in one function and call that function.
